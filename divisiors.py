# Create a program that asks the user for a number and
# then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number and will tell you is it prime or not !
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
# For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
